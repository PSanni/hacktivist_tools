DEPENDENCIES:

- You need pygoogle, grab it from here and install it:
https://github.com/rnikhil275/pygoogle

- You also need the trunacated list of search terms:
http://pastebin.com/vyb8bjjm

Save it as 'strippedkws' in the same directory as this script.

Now just run the script and analyze the results. This saves a lot of
time because this script automatically chooses 3 keywords and searches google
for you. The results are returned to stout in the terminal. If someone wants to
help figure out what comes next, please PM me on irc.anonops.com , my sn is
shellzrus.
