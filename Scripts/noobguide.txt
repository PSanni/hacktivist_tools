        folder(on an empty space), and click:  Open Command Window Here  , now a terminal/cmd/black box has opened again, however
        the first text is different(its the location of this folder)

        typing your password, thats completely normal, if done hit enter
 Step9: Make sure that the browser that pops up is in full window mode, else it wont work.
 
        DONE! Now you can see that approved accounts are getting fully automatically reported!
