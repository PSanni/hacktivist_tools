Hello!

This ever changing and growing bot is meant to take an input query and return a fuckload of data from various social media sites. eventually it will attempt arabic translation and other cool things like colors, and bold!

In the meantime install nodejs 5.0.0 and run the following in this directory if anything doesnt work

$ npm install twitter

$ npm install google

$ npm install ddg

$ npm install facebook-search

$ npm install node-irc

$ npm install tumblr


you will then need to put your facebook api client and secret keys as well as your twitter api keys into the apropriate configuration directives.

$ node isis.js allahu& node isis.js ackbar&


if you prefer to just start scraping the web immediatly, npkm install google and then 

$ node google.js `shuf -n 1 keywords.txt`


this will give you a bunch of garbage to sort through. enjoy.
