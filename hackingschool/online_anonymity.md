Anonymity is the quality or state of being unknown to most people or just plain being 
anonymous.



Tools/Tricks of the Trade:
========================================================


- VPN
- Anonymizer Proxy
- The Onion Router
- Private Browsing
- Virtual Machines
- DNS Leak Test
- Turn off Location Services



VPN
========================================================

Using a VPN will allow you to mask/hide your real IP address, to prevent ISP, Gov’t, Law Enforcement and other Bad Actors from tracking your activity online.  But using  VPN is not a guaranteed anonymity.  Some VPN providers logs the activity for the last 7 days and during that period a profile might be created based on your activity.  Make sure you select a provider that doesn’t log your activity and is located to a country without any data retention laws.



Anonymizer Proxy
========================================================


Aside from connecting to VPN server you could also connect to an Anonymizer Proxy to hide your internet traffic.  It acts as an intermediary between the user and the rest of the internet.  In this way it will allow the user to become untraceable.  A good choice of proxy should be located in Sweden and Russia



Tor (The Onion Router)
========================================================


Tor has been designed to anonymise your online activity.  It directs internet traffic to thousands of relay to  conceal a user's location and usage from surveillance  or usage analysis.

To make sure that your activity is not tracked use private browsing and prevent javascript and especially HTML 5 canvas to be executed by the browser.

A good practice is also to use a VPN over Tor, just make sure to get one that provides proper VPN over Tor



Private Browsing
========================================================


It is a feature in the browser to prevent websites from tracking you.  This feature is quite common in Tor Browsers.

Things to remember:

1. Prevent javascript and HTML 5 canvas to be executed by the browser.
2. Always avoid sites that uses Google cookies (or cookies in general) or ads


Virtual Machines
========================================================


By Using a Virtual Machine/Guest OS adds an additional layer of anonymity.  From your Host OS you connect to a VPN, make sure your Virtual Machine's network setting is set to NAT, and from the Virtual Machine connect to another VPN server.  You could also connect to Tor to add another hop



DNS Leak Test
========================================================


DNS Leak Test will allow users to verify if their online activity is really anonymous.  To verify you can go to this website, https://dnsleaktest.com, for testing and ways on how to fix any DNS leaks.


Location Services
========================================================


Browsers and  Mobile Apps/OS have the capability of tracking your location.  From this information a company, or anyone who has the data,  could create a profile of you.  With your data they could push location based ads and worst track your movement.  Always remember to turn off location services in your OS (desktop and mobile), Browser and Applications.
